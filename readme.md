# DSS File Examples

This repository contains some simple example files, based on a proposed network
by its creators, Paulo Radatz and Celso Rocha.

The purpose of this repository is solely to be cloned in a Google Colab
environment to facilitate access to the DSS files where the networks are modeled
for some of the main simulation cases of `OpenDSS`.
